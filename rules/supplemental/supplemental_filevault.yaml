  The supplemental guidance found in this section is applicable for the following rules:
    * sysprefs_filevault_enforce

  In macOS 10.15 the internal Apple File System (APFS) volume (including both system and data storage) can be protected by FileVault.
  NOTE: On non-T2 hardware, FileVault uses an AES-XTS data encryption algorithm to protect full volumes of internal and external storage. Macs with the T2 chip utilize the hardware security features of the chip.

  FileVault is described in detail here: link:https://support.apple.com/guide/security/when-filevault-is-turned-on-sec4c6dc1b6e/1/web/1[].

  FileVault can be enabled in two ways within the macOS. It can be managed using the fdesetup command or by a Configuration Profile. When enabling FileVault via either of the aforementioned methods, you will be required to enter a username and password, which must be a local OpenDirectory account with a valid SecureToken password.

  ==== Using the fdesetup Command
  When enabling FileVault via the command line in the Terminal application, you can run the following command.
  [source,bash]
  ----
  /usr/bin/fdesetup enable
  ----
  Running this command will prompt you for a username and password and then enable FileVault and return the personal recovery key. There are a number of management features available when managing FileVault via the command line that are not available when using a configuration profile. More information on these management features is available in the man page for fdesetup. 
  
  NOTE: Apple has deprecated fdesetup command line tool from recognizing user name and password for security reasons and may remove the ability in future versions of macOS.

  ==== Using a Configuration Profile
  
  When managing FileVault with a configuration profile, you must deploy a profile with the payload type com.apple.MCX.FileVault2. When using the Enable key to enable FileVault with a configuration profile, you must include 1 of the following:
  
  [source,xml]
  ----
  <key>Enable</key>
  <string>On</string>
  <key>Defer</key>
  <true />
  ----
  [source,xml]
  ----
  <key>Enable</key>
  <string>On</string>
  <key>UserEntersMissingInfo</key>
  <true/>
  ----

  If using the Defer key it will prompt for the user name and password at logout.

  The UserEntersMissingInfo key will only work if installed through manual installation, and it will prompt for the username and password immediately. 

  When using a configuration profile, you can escrow the Recovery key to a Mobile Device Management (MDM) server. Documentation for that can be found on Apple’s Developer site: link:https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicemanagement/fderecoverykeyescrow[].

  It’s recommended that you use a Personal Recovery key instead of an Institutional key as it will generate a specific key for each device. You can find more guidance on choosing a recover key here: link:https://docs.jamf.com/technical-papers/jamf-pro/administering-filevault-macos/10.7.1/Choosing_a_Recovery_Key.html[].

  NOTE: FileVault currently only uses password-based authentication and cannot be done using a smartcard or any other type of multi-factor authentication.
