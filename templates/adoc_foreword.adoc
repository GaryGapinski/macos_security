== Foreword

The macOS Security Compliance Project is an open source effort to provide a programmatic approach to generating security guidance. The configuration settings in this document were derived from National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-53, _Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations_, Revision 4.

This project can be used as a resource to easily create customized security baselines of technical security controls by leveraging a library of atomic actions which are mapped to the compliance requirements defined in NIST SP 800-53 (Rev. 4). It can also be used to develop customized guidance to meet the particular cybersecurity needs of any organization.  

The objective of this effort was to simplify and radically accelerate the process of producing up-to-date macOS security guidance that is also accessible to any organization and tailorable to meet each organizationâ€™s specific security needs.
